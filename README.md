# ResourceCounter

[Pixin](https://github.com/AnotherPillow/Pixin) + [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) = ResourceCounter

This is a (1.8) forge port of [Pixin](https://github.com/AnotherPillow/Pixin). Initial gradle configuration based on [ModHider](https://github.com/Fabi019/ForgeModHider).

## Usage

1. Install Essential & [ResourceCounter](https://github.com/AnotherPillow/ResourceCounter)
2. Run the game once with Essential
3. Remove the original Essential jar from your mods folder
4. Copy the actual Essential mod from `<minecraft dir>/essential` (it'll be a .jar and be something like `Essential (forge_1.8.9).jar`) to your mods folder.
5. Run the game

Alternatively, if you have any mods that require Essential and install it automatically, you can simply use one of those without having to copy the jar from the essential folder.

## Clarifications of Licenses

- No, I'm not associated with Pixie or Essential.
- No, this doesn't use Essential code.
- Yes, ask me for licensing stuff Pixie people if you want. (or just do it yourself, it's not that complex of a thing to do (despite how long it took))
